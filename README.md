Hi, I’m Lingyu Du, a PhD student in the Embedded and Networked Systems(ENS) of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS) at Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands, supervised by Dr. Guohao Lan.

I’m interested in eye-tracking, mobile computing, computer vision and reinforcement learning.
 
I received my M.Sc. degree and B.Eng. degree in Control Science and Engineering from Harbin Institute of technology, China in July, 2021 and July, 2019 respectively.
