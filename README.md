Hi, I’m Lingyu Du, a PhD student in the Embedded Systems(ES) group of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS) at Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands, supervised by Dr. Guohao Lan.

I’m interested in eye-tracking, mobile computing, computer vision and reinforcement learning.
 
I received my M.Sc. degree and B.Eng. degree in Control Science and Engineering from Harbin Institute of technology, China, in 2021 and 2019 respectively.
